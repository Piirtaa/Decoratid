LongIdBroker is a container/broker of long ids, that uses a store to hold the next block of ids.
It's polyfacing.

Fluently polyfaced as:
	polyface.IsIdBroker(some id broker info, store, etc); - attaches id broker
	polyface.AsIdBroker(); - returns id broker


Why would you use this?  In case you want to give a Polyface a range of Ids to use, and have this range be managed by an external 
store.
