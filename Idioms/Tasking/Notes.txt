A task is some logicOf<TArg,TResult> that is wrapped in a state machine (Pending|InProcess|Completed|Errored|Cancelled),
and given an Id and a backreference to a store of ITasks.

Using decorations, additional behaviour is added to tasks such as:
    -introducing a task dependency.     eg.  ITask.DependsOn(task ids)
    -events                             eg.  ITask.Eventing
    -conditional triggers               eg.  ITask.Triggered
                                            or ITask.ANDCancelWhen, .ANDPerformWhen, .ANDCompleteWhen, .ANDFailWhen
    -indicate the task is synchronous   eg.  ITask.IsSynchronous
    -indicate the task is asynchronous  eg.  ITask.IsAsynchronous(completeWhen, failWhen)

A master task, JobTask, runs the whole deal, iterating thru the tasks in the task store and firing them off.
It itself is implemented as a task that has a dependency on all the other tasks.  

An example:

//job store has eviction but each item is default no eviction
//  add item by item eviction decoration
    job.Expires().On.Floating()...etc.  the Expires() call returns IExpirable decoration.  each decoration fluent call must wrapplace


var job = Job.New()  or Job.New

    

var logic.MakeTask("task1").PerformWhen(condition);
