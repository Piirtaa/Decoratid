***Applies only the ConditionOf Things

Supplies the context value (as valueOf) to a conditionOf, turning it into a condition .

Fluently decorate as:
	conditionOf.WithValue( valueOf );


We might use this when we want to build up a condition from the logic first, and then supply a context later on
in the expression, possibly linking it to some "calculated value" derived from a Polyface.
