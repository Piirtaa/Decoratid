ConditionalWaiter waits for a condition to be true, or until a stop waiting condition is true.  
It's polyfacing.

Fluently polyfaced as:
	polyface.IsConditionalWaiter(wait condition, stopwaiting condition); - attaches a new ConditionalWaiter
	polyface.AsConditionalWaiter(); - returns the ConditionalWaiter

Fluently decorated as:
	valueOf.WaitUntil(wait condition, stopwaiting condition);
	logic.WaitUntil(wait condition, stopwaiting condition);
	condition.WaitUntil(wait condition, stopwaiting condition);
