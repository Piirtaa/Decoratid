Variations on a string AKA stringable

Allows decorations around core stringyness. 

Eg.
	-The LengthPrefix decorations specify the exact layout of datasizes of the data we're storing,
	and prefix the actual data with this, so that special character concerns during string parsing go away.
	This also has the characteristic of working regardless of the nesting of dehydrated data 
	as when non-trivial object graphing is done.  
	-Decorations that do CRC or Hashing or some other data integrity check are also possible with this
	idiom.
	-Encryption can be introduced here also
