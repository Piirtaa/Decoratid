Dependencies:

A "dependency", IDependencyOf is modelled as something (of T) that has a list of other things (of T) it depends on.  
A set of dependencies can be sorted from least dependent to most.  
A concrete instance of IDependencyOf, DependencyOf, exposes static methods for sorting a graph of like.
DependencySorter performs the sorting of a set of dependencies.  



Named Dependencies:

amenable to this, as they are built with string).





Attributes are limited to using value types properties, so proxies to the actual dependency instance are needed.
Thus NamedDependency is created to use strings as proxies, with an additional classifying property, DependencyTag.
The Attribute wraps this class, and IHasNamedDependency and IHasNamedDependencies expose it via interface compatibility.

AttributedDependencyUtil is a utility class enabling mining of dependency info from types via their attributes.
